                 <p>THIS IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU OR THE ENTITY THAT YOU REPRESENT (hereinafter "You" or "Your") AND AquaAPI LLC (hereinafter "AquaAPI") GOVERNING YOUR USE OF AquaAPI suite of online software and services.</p> 
                 <h3>Acceptance of the Terms</h3>

You can accept the Terms by checking a checkbox or clicking on a button indicating your acceptance of the terms or by actually using the Services.

                 <h3>Description of Service</h3>
                 
                <p>We provide an array of software and services for including web applications, mobile applications and application integrations ("Service" or "Services"). You may use the Services for your personal and business use or for internal business purpose in the organization that you represent. You may connect to the Services using any Internet browser supported by the Services. You are responsible for obtaining access to the Internet and the equipment necessary to use the Services. You can create and edit content with your user account and if you choose to do so, you can publish and share such content.</p>
                
                <h3>Modification of Terms of Service</h3>
			<p>We may modify the Terms upon notice to you at any time through a service announcement or by sending email to your primary email address. You may terminate your use of the Services by providing AquaAPI notice by email within 30 days of being notified of the availability of the modified Terms if the Terms are modified in a manner that substantially affects your rights in connection with use of the Services. In the event of such termination, you will be entitled to prorated refund of the unused portion of any prepaid fees. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date of any change to the Terms will be deemed to be your agreement to the modified Terms.</p>

                <h3>User Sign up Obligations</h3>
                <p>You need to sign up for a user account by providing all required information in order to access or use the Services. If you represent an organization and wish to use the Services for corporate internal use, we recommend that you, and all other users from your organization, sign up for user accounts by providing your corporate contact information. In particular, we recommend that you use your corporate email address. You agree to: a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the sign up process; and b) maintain and promptly update the information provided during sign up to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete, or if AquaAPI has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete, AquaAPI may terminate your user account and refuse current or future use of any or all of the Services.</p>
                
                <h3>Personal Information and Privacy</h3>
